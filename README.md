# Personal-Finance-Tracker
A simple, beginner-friendly finance dashboard built using Python and Streamlit to help manage income, expenses, and visualize trends.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Motivation

After searching through various project ideas online, I decided to create something that would help me in my daily life â€” a Personal Finance Tracker.

Not only does it solve a real problem I face, but it also pushes me forward on my journey in the data analytics field. Through this project, I applied Python, Pandas, and Streamlit to build something practical, while improving my skills in data handling, visualization, and app development

While building this app, I faced several challenges like:
- CSV formatting and data overwriting issues
- Date parsing errors
- Chart rendering problems
- Unexpected Streamlit crashes

I nearly gave up at times, but I kept going â€” turning to documentation, Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and blog posts for help. Every bug taught me something new, and I came out stronger with better problem-solving skills.
